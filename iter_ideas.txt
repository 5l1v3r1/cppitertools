x at a time iterator. Lets say you have a list
    [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
and you want to iterate over 3 elements at a time. You could create three 
iterators and incrment them simulatneously, or do something like this.
    for (auto tuple : group_x(list,4))
In this you get the first 4 then all iters are incremeted by 1 each time so 
the iterations would be  

1 2 3
2 3 4
3 4 5
4 5 6
5 6 7
6 7 8


zip_longest using boost::optional or std::optional when support exists.
useful if a lot of the containers are of different sizes. may want to write
a different zip_get that works better with optional
